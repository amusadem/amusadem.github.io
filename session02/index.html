       <p><span class= "subheader">Built to Last</span><br>
       A bargain blender's not a bargain if it doesn't last. We know purchasing a Vitamix blender is an investment.
       But Vitamix blenders are built to last, helping you buy <b>dependable</b>, not disposable.</p>

       <p><span class= "subheader">Easy to Clean</span><br>

       less </b> - no disassembly required.</p>

       <p><span class= "subheader">The Difference Is in the Blend</span><br>
