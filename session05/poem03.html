      <p>Caged Bird</p>
   </div>
<p>
A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>
and floats downstream<br>
till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and dares to claim the sky.<br></p>
<p>
But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br></p>
<p>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.</p>
<p>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own<br></p>
<p>
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams<br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br></p>
<p>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill <br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br></p>
